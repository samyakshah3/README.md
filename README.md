👋 Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a supply chain professional with a strong background in Strategic Sourcing, Procurement, Planning, and Supply Chain Optimization. With experience managing RFQ, RFI, RFP processes and overseeing Purchase Order execution for critical electronics suppliers, as well as Demand & Production Planning, I bring expertise in driving efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

🎓 Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Industrial Engineering at the State University of New York at Buffalo, expected to graduate in December 2024, I am passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to enhance supply chain performance.

🌐 Interested in Supply Chain Analytics, Demand Planning, Procurement, Sustainable Supply Chains, and Implementing AI Technologies in Supply Chains, I excel in data driven decision-making and process optimization.

🧘🏻‍♂️ Apart from work, I enjoy [cooking](https://www.instagram.com/samyak_shah_777?igsh=ZzF5aG1vNGhsZGp6), fitness, following soccer, and practicing meditation and mindfulness.
